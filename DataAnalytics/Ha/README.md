# Countrywide Happiness as a proxy of Food Security and Quality
## *TL;DR*
* As expected, the higher a country scores on the World Happiness Report, the higher it is likely to score in food security metrics (Overall security, affordability, availability, quality, and resilience of supply)
  * Correlation values of food security metrics and certain World Happiness Report variables (Score, GDP/capita, Social Support, and Healthy Life Expectancy) between 0.75-*0.95*, indicating a very strong relationship
  * Correlation values for other WHR variables (Freedom to Make Life Choices and Perceptions of Corruption was less impactful, however still signficant ranging from 0.35-0.5
* These findings are understood by further researcher exploring the political dogma and cultural attitudes/climates of countries in the analysis
  * Scandinavian countries score top ranks in happiness year after year due, in part, to their left-leaning politics allowing an expansive amount of freedoms to its citizens directly increasing perceived happiness. This secondarily affects food security as Finnish culture places an importance on wellbeing of the individual, leading to higher quality food and produce being subsidized and available. 
  *The inverse is true for countries that ranked low in the World Happiness Report; countries in sub-Saharan Africa scored low in metrics due to socioeconomic, historical, and civil hardships that are present after centuries of misuse and intentional wrongdoing. These hardships avert attention away from societal improvement and individual wellbeing to other, more vital causes such as infrastructure, subsidies for other sectors (ie. Industrial/Labor), and in some less fortunate cases, corruption; These decisions/actions contribute to lowering food security in the country substantially.

## Introduction 
This projects is an attempt to visualize the relationships between reported happiness and societal wellness metrics in the context of food afforability, availability, quality, and the resilience of the country's food supply. 
* Data sourced from World Happiness Project and Global Food Security Index reports (2015-2019)
* Global Food Security Index tracks afforablilty, availability, and quality of food in the country (https://foodsecurityindex.eiu.com/)
* World Happiness Project reports a generalized score after analyzing multiple key metrics such as societal freedom, GDP per capita, and more (https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2020/)
