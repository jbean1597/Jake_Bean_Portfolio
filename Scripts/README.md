# Scripts
## About
This folder contains all of the scripts I have created including a webscraper, etc, and etc. Feel free to use the code implemented in any of these projects to test it out and see the performance for yourself.

### Index
1. Automatic Trading Bot(https://github.com/jbean1597/PersonalPortfolio/blob/main/Scripts/TradingBot/TradingBot.ipynb)
2. Webscraper

## Project 1: Trading Bot
* This project is an ongoing work and will be updated as such
* First phase of establishing API connections to a trading account and performing simple trades with multiple deciding factors for limit orders was successful
* The next portion I will be working on is improving the trading strategy and automating the process to run throughout the day
* The final step will be implementing the bot in my own trading account and letting it handle my money to see how it performs

## Project 2: Webscraper
* Complimentary project to the trading bot since the webscraper will be used to gather stock data such as price, symbol, percent change, and more
* Will be used for stock analysis in Project 1 for hourly (or faster) order placements and stock data gathering
