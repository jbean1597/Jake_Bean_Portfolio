# Jake Bean - Personal Projects
Data Science and Analytics Portfolio

## About Me
Hello!

My name is Jake Bean and welcome to my personal project portfolio. I obtained a Bachelors of Science degree in Geology with a concentration in Specialized Curriculum (more natural and computational sciences focused) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was there I took a Computer Science course where we studied Python and MATLAB and my interest in coding began. From then on I have practiced my Python skills continuously, taught myself SQL as well, implemented Python code for correlational data analysis in past jobs, and more. This portfolio is a showcase of the skills I have gained and the projects that helped me do it along the way.  

I'm currently updating and adding more to this portfolio as I take on new projects that interest me!

## Index
This repository contains all of the projects that I have done while teaching myself coding. I have separated them into two types: Data Analytics and Scripts.
