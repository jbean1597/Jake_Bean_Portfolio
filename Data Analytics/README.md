# Data Analytics and Visualization Projects
## Introduction
I was introduced to coding my last year in university and since then have cultivated a deep interest in the science of data analysis and visualizations. This protfolio contains the projects I believe I did the best on and the ones that greatly improved my understanding of the material. I continue to practice the skills I have gained and am now focused on improving my machine/deep learning abilities. All of these projects were done in Python with the help of its libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, and SQLite3.
